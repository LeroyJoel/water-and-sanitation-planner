**Water and Sanitation Report: Abinse, Benue State**

**Executive Summary:**

Abinse, Benue State, is a community of approximately 3000 residents.  Currently, 30% lack access to toilets, and an estimated 40% lack access to safe water, primarily relying on the potentially contaminated River Benue. This report outlines a comprehensive water and sanitation intervention plan designed to address these critical challenges, improve public health, and enhance the overall well-being of the community.  The plan includes water quality assessments, borehole drilling, rainwater harvesting, community toilet construction, and a sanitation education program. The total estimated cost is ₦20,200,000.  The project is expected to significantly reduce waterborne diseases, improve maternal and child health, and boost community productivity.


**1. Identified Needs (Baseline Data):**

* **Community:** Abinse, Benue State
* **Population:** 3000 residents
* **Access to Safe Water:** Approximately 60% have access to a water source (River Benue), but its safety is questionable.  An estimated 40% (1200 people) lack access to safe water.  The number and quality of existing boreholes require further investigation.
* **Access to Toilets/Latrines:** 70% have access; 30% (900 people) lack access, resulting in open defecation.
* **Major Challenges:** Unsafe water source (River Benue), inadequate sanitation (open defecation), need for water quality testing, and potential need for additional improved water sources and sanitation facilities.


**2. Proposed Solutions:**

* **Water Supply Improvement:**
    * **Water Quality Assessment of River Benue:**  A comprehensive assessment to determine its potability (₦500,000), timeline: 1 month.
    * **Borehole Drilling:** Two boreholes to provide safe water to a significant portion of the population (₦6,000,000), timeline: 6 months.
    * **Household Rainwater Harvesting Systems:**  Installation in at least 600 homes (20% of households) to supplement borehole water (₦12,000,000), timeline: 3 months.
    * **Water Treatment Plant (Contingency):**  Consideration dependent on River Benue water quality assessment results. Cost to be determined post-assessment.
* **Sanitation Improvement:**
    * **Community Toilets:** Construction of three community toilets (one per 300 people) to address the lack of sanitation facilities (₦1,500,000), timeline: 6 months.
    * **Sanitation Education Program:**  Ongoing community education on hygiene and sanitation practices (₦200,000), timeline: ongoing.

**3. Project Timeline:**

* **Phase 1 (Months 1-3):** Water quality assessment, design and commencement of borehole drilling, and initial community engagement for sanitation education.
* **Phase 2 (Months 4-6):** Completion of borehole drilling and commencement of rainwater harvesting system installation.
* **Phase 3 (Months 7-12):** Completion of rainwater harvesting systems installation and construction of community toilets.  Continued sanitation education.

**4. Total Estimated Cost:** ₦20,200,000 (excluding potential cost of water treatment plant)

**5. Public Health Impact:**

The intervention aims to significantly reduce the incidence of waterborne diseases, particularly diarrheal diseases.  A 40% reduction in diarrheal disease incidence within two years is projected.  Improvements in maternal and child health are also anticipated, with projected reductions of 15-20% in under-five mortality and 10-15% in maternal mortality within three years.  These improvements will lead to increased productivity, improved economic activity, and an overall enhanced quality of life for the Abinse community.  Continuous monitoring using existing Nigeria CDC and WHO surveillance systems will be incorporated.

**6. Clear Action Plan and Next Steps:**

* **Phase 1:** Secure funding, conduct water quality assessment of the River Benue, commence borehole drilling and begin community mobilization and education.
* **Phase 2:**  Complete borehole drilling, initiate rainwater harvesting system installations, and continue sanitation education.
* **Phase 3:**  Complete rainwater harvesting and community toilet construction, conduct post-intervention monitoring and evaluation to assess the impact of the intervention on health outcomes.  Data from the Nigeria CDC and WHO will be crucial here.
* **Ongoing:**  Community engagement, maintenance of water and sanitation infrastructure, and continued sanitation education.

**Note:** Costs are estimates. Contingencies should be included in the budget for unforeseen issues and inflation.  The community’s active participation will be critical to ensure long-term sustainability.  Further detailed cost breakdowns and material specifications will be provided in subsequent project documents.
